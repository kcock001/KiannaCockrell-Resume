        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second year pre-business major at the University of California Riverside. I recently switched my majors from Neuroscience to Pre-Business because I realized that although I wanted to go to school and become a doctor I was not enjoying the science courses that I was taking and decided that I wanted to be a business woman instead. I would like to own a company or work as a Cheif Financial Officer for an existing company. I do not see myself as very creative, but if I am able to come up with an idea on my own to make into a company I'd love to start it and work to make it grwow. I am looking forward to growing in my education to gain more knowledge that I can use when going into a professional position. After completing my Bachelor's Degree I'd like to move on to working on a Masters Degree in Finance.<br><br>

        I am currently working for UCR Residential Life as a Residential Advisor in the Lothian Residence Hall on campus. In this position, I help first year students through their transition from high school to college, build relationships with first year students and staff, and create a friendly environment for the first years to feel comfortable where they are living away from home. In order to build these relationships and make the residence hall feel more like a home for residents I make posters every quarter to be put up around the hall and I create programs for residents to do activities together while learning about ways they can grow and use resources around campus. These programs are usually activities that are fun, relaxing and resourceful. For example, my most recent program was Do It Yourself Jounraling. In this program, residents were provided markers, journals, stickers and washi tape to design their own journal. Some residents designed their jounral for a savings tracker and others designed pages to track their mood.<br><br>

        I am interested in positions that can grow my business skills. I have had a few positions in the food industry and I have worked in an office for a small manufacturing company. In the food industry I focused on customer service, prepping ingredients, checking inventory, and keeping the various work areas clean. In the office I started as an Administrative Assistant screening phone calls, cleaning the office, and organizing. Then I moved up to account management where I began to manage over 150 large accounts. I really enjoyed customer service because a lot of customers were very nice and appreciative. Additionally, it was great learning how to manage accounts in a company and see how a manufacturing company works. I'd love to grow my customer service skills, account management skills, and professional skills.
